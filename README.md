# Fast Multilevel Solution of the Secular Equation
The secular equation arises in updating the eigenvalues of an $n \times n$ matrix after a rank-1 update. This reduces to finding the $n$ roots of a secular equation. In this repository we implement an $O(n)$ multilevel algorthm for solving this equation.

Applications:
* Generating random graphs and calculating the Von Neumann Entropy.
